Cryptography using AES Algorithm (Encryption and Decryption using AES Algorithm)

C# supports several encryption algorithms through the System.Security.Cryptography namespace. Here is a list of commonly used encryption algorithms available in C#:

1. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

2. DES (Data Encryption Standard): DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm with a fixed key size of 56 bits.

3. 3DES (Triple DES): 3DES applies DES three times to each data block. It provides a larger key size than DES for increased security.

4. RC2 (Rivest Cipher 2): RC2 is a symmetric encryption algorithm that supports key sizes ranging from 40 to 128 bits.

5. RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4): RC4 is a symmetric stream cipher. It doesn't have a fixed block size and supports key sizes up to 2048 bits.

6. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. It uses a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption.

7. DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): DSA is a digital signature algorithm used for generating and verifying digital signatures.

8. ECDiffieHellman (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman): ECDiffieHellman is an asymmetric key exchange algorithm based on elliptic curve cryptography.

9. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code): HMAC is a construction for creating a MAC (Message Authentication Code) using a cryptographic hash function.
